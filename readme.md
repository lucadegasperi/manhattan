##What's this?
Manhattan is a highly opinionated SASS library for easing the pain of big CSS development. It has two primary purposes: Prototyping page elements by using classes to abstract the element's behaviour at different resolutions. After prototyping, generate clean and lightweight CSS by using SASS hidden classes.

Use Manhattan if:
- You need css prototyping and abstractions.
- You understand/need scalability and reusable code.
- You are a confident/competent developer SASS.
Do not use Manhattan if:
- You need a framework that supplies design (Use Bootstrap for that).

##Browser Support
Manhattan is intended to work only in modern browsers. It takes advantage of normalize.css and global box-sizing:border-box;. As such, Manhattan is intended for IE8 and above only.

##What's inside
Manhattan comes with some lovely features
- Media Queries abstraction
- Spacing Units
- Percentage Widths
- Grid System
- Color Fillings
- Font Sizes
- Debug Options

Everything is easily extensible and customizable.
